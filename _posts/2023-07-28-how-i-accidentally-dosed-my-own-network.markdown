title:  "How I accidentally DoSed my own network"

As the sole person tasked with configuring the network in the family, I was surprised when my brother one day told me that he was not able to access his banking website.

Upon hearing this I began to run the basic diagnostic steps and observed the following:

* The error code shown was ERR_ADDRESS_NOT_REACHABLE
* The site was unreachable despite changing browsers and restarting the operating system
* Pinging the IP address directly did not return any packets
* Other websites like google.com was completely accessible (!)
* Other devices could visit the affected site (!)
* Changing networks to a temporary hotspot resolved the issue (!)

The last three observations posed a bad "smell" as isolating for a variable usually appears to create a binary effect on the problem: Either the theoretical solution fixes the problem, or it does nothing. In this case, it appears that the root problem lies within the network. But how would the network be the problem when other devices in the same network can reach the site just fine? Shouldn't a network related problem affect all devices in the same network equally? Unless...

Unfortunately my naive belief that the problem was a simple fix(which in hindsight, actually was) led to false conclusions that the PC was completely at fault, despite no changes being done to PC for the past week before the issue was reported. After roughly an hour of hopeless troubleshooting and even changing the router's DNS configuration, I accessed the network logs to see if it might provide some helpful information. Here was what I found:

Ok, cool, now we're getting somewhere. Based off the logs provided, it appears that some devices are not receiving a IP from the DHCP server. Should be no problem, let's assign a DHCP reservation to the affected PC and get this over with.

> Based off the logs provided, it appears that some devices are not receiving a IP from the DHCP server. 

Except that the assigned PC still didn't get an IP reservation and the PC still couldn't access the site.

Ok, maybe I was just unlucky. Maybe I accidentally typed an static ip that was already taken by another client. This time, let's try an static ip address of 192.168.1.88.

No dice. Let's try 192.168.1.89.

Nope. Now 192.168.1.90.

Nada. One more time for 192.168.1.91...

Now at this point I'm sweating bullets because something is clearly wrong, as last time I checked our DHCP reservation range was from 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.255, and we didn't have 253 unique devices in the house. Out of curiosity to see which IP addresses are open, I ran a blind arp(conversion hash table for IP to MAC addresses) scan:

Aha! I knew it! Some jackass sneaked into my network and started a [DHCP Starvation Attack](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/blog/technology/networking/what-is-a-dhcp-starvation-attack)! Let's get on the router and ban this fool *"a6:2f:be:d4:65:46"* so we can at least open some IP addresses. 

Wait a second...*"a6:2f:be:d4:65:46"* looks familiar...wasn't that a machine I had to manually reserve a static IP for? Hold up...that's my own nginx virtual machine. I'm the one hogging all the IPs. That "jackass" was me.

> That "jackass" was me.

I immediately checked my virtual machines, and sure enough, most of them were running but unable to read/write due to a separate problem with a faulty SSD I had ignored from the previous night...

What happened was that somewhere along the line of my SSD disconnecting and the nginx VM attempting to access/write a file, the I/O failure somehow prompted nginx to request and hold every DHCP address available in the subnet masks in a loop, which explains the DHCP requests, ARP table, and why some of the devices that were already assigned an ip address showed no symptoms. 

After taking 5 seconds to turn off my virtualization server, the IP addresses cleared up and the PC was finally able to access chase.com:

And that's the story on how I accidentally banged my head against a wall for 2 hours.
