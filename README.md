# [cnshing.github.io](cnshing.github.io)

Jekyll [website](cnshing.github.io) based off [Scriptor](https://github.com/JustGoodThemes/Scriptor-Jekyll-Theme).

Notable changes include:
* About me will always start at the front of the page, allowing users to get a preview of the blog before scrolling down and reading the posts
* An option to show/hide the author footers at the end of each post, since it can get repetitive especially for single author blogs
* A seperate page border colour option for situations where the selected colour looks fine for the border but is not sufficient for text
* Increased navigation text constrast to a ratio of at leats 4.5 to meet accessibility requirements
* Support for feeds via [jekyll-feed](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed) plugin, since the base jekyll installation already included it

Todo:
1. Add a visual demostration of hiding author footers
2. Decide whether or not to remove jekyll-feed
3. Add customization options for animation snappyness
